# Cemetery Biography App (Working Title)

This mobile app helps users identify gravestones in U.S. cemeteries and discover biographical information about the people buried there. By combining GPS data, image recognition, and historical records, the app makes it easy for users to explore family histories and local heritage directly from a smartphone.

## 🔍 What the App Does

- Uses smartphone GPS and camera to detect and read gravestone inscriptions
- Matches grave data (name, birth/death years, location) to public memorial records
- Pulls extended biographical information, including family tree data, from FamilySearch
- Helps users learn more about the people buried nearby and their life stories

## 📦 Data Sources

- [Find a Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/) – indexed through FamilySearch
- [BillionGraves](https://billiongraves.com/) – indexed through FamilySearch
- [FamilySearch.org](https://www.familysearch.org/) – for family tree data, relationships, and historical records

## 🔗 FamilySearch Integration

This app uses the FamilySearch API (pending approval) to:
- Search for indexed burial records (Find a Grave, BillionGraves)
- Retrieve structured genealogical data (birthplaces, family members, life sketches)
- Link users to full FamilySearch person profiles for deeper exploration

The app promotes FamilySearch’s mission by helping users connect with family history through real-world cemetery visits and encourages contributions to the Family Tree platform.

## 🎯 Who It's For

- Cemetery visitors and tourists
- Amateur genealogists and local historians
- Educators and students learning about community history
- Families exploring ancestral roots

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- Flutter (mobile app)
- Google Maps or Mapbox SDK (for location context)
- OCR and image processing tools for reading inscriptions
- RESTful API integration with FamilySearch
